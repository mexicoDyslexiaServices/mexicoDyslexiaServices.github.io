									<h2>Dyslexia Misconceptions vs. Facts</h2>
									<table class="default">
											<tr>
													<th>Misconception</th>
													<th>Fact</th>
											</tr>
											<tr>
													<td>Dyslexia is rare</td>
													<td>In the United States, NIH research has shown that dyslexia affects 5-10% of the population, with estimates as high as 17%. Dyslexia is the most common of all neuro-cognitive learning differences.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
													<td>Dyslexia impacts intelligence</td>
													<td>Dyslexia and intelligence are NOT connected. Many dyslexic individuals are very bright and creative and have accomplished amazing things as adults.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
													<td>Dyslexia is a visual problem, and dyslexics see words backwards and letters reversed.
													</td>
													<td>This is a time-old misconception that dyslexia impacts vision. Instead, the dyslexic brain struggles to connect visual symbols to specific sounds, contributing to letter reversals and/or confusion.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
													<td>A person with dyslexia will never learn to read</td>
													<td>Dyslexia is a lifelong learning disability. However-early, intensive, and systematic intervention helps students keep up and retain grade levels in school, as well as minimize the negative effects dyslexia can have, such as low self-esteem and poor self-concept as a learner.
													</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
													<td>Dyslexia cannot be diagnosed until third grade.</td>
													<td>Professionals with extensive training in diagnosis can accurately identify the precursors to developing dyslexia as early as age 5. We can make a definitive diagnosis as soon as the child begins to struggle with learning to read, spell, and write. The sooner a diagnosis is made, the quicker the child can get help, and the more likely we are to prevent secondary blows to their self-esteem.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Children with dyslexia are just lazy. They should try harder.</td>
												<td>If there is ONE myth that we'd like to see disappear, it is this one. Lack of awareness about the disorder among educators and parents has often resulted in the child being branded as "lazy." What frequently happens is that these children learn that they are going to fail at tasks of reading, spelling, and writing; it becomes an attempt at self-preservation (i.e., rather than try and fail, it is safer to just not try or work laboriously to no avail). Research has shown, with the technology of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), that those with dyslexia use a different part of their brain when reading and working with language. Dyslexic people show an abnormal pattern of brain function when reading: underactivity in some regions, overactivity in another which, according to research, accounts for the difficulty they have in extracting meaning from the printed word. The findings provide evidence that people with dyslexia are not poorly taught, lazy, or stupid, but have an inborn brain difference that has nothing to do with intelligence. If students with dyslexia do not receive the right type of intervention and/or classroom accommodations, they often struggle in school -- despite being bright, motivated, and spending hours on homework assignments.
													.</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td>Dyslexia is only a deficit</td>
											<td>
												Although dyslexics experiences deficits in the areas of phonological awareness and phonics, and need additional support to develop literacy skills, dyslexics demonstrate many strengths such as:
												<ul>
													<li>
														Problem solving
													</li>
													<li>
														Creativity
													</li>
													<li>
														Observance
													</li>
													<li>
														High levels of empathy
													</li>
													<li>
														Excellent big-picture thinking
													</li>
													<li>
														Good at making connections
													</li>
													<li>
														Strong narrative reasoning
													</li>
													<li>
														Three-dimensional thinking
													</li>
												</ul>
												Note: You can now list Dyslexic Thinking as a skill on LinkedIn
